This Break_up Detection module finds the break-up date on the given annual daily hydrographs. The range of years can be unlimited but the "leap year correction" must be applied to the dataset, so that 29 Feb of the leap years must be removed from the data.

The Year365 calculates the 100-year average daily discharge and shows the extreme periods in different time intervals

The extremes.mlx plots the extreme values of discharge data

the duration_belo_.....mlx finds the number of days in each year, which have lower discharge based on the threshold calculated in Year365
